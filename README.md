# Pomodoro

This is my capstone project from the frontend development bootcamp [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/).

Pomodoro helps you to organize your daily todo's and split your working time into 25 minutes intervals. While your working sessions you can hear white noise sound that supports your laser focus.

A **live demo** is available [here](https://pomodoro-23add.firebaseapp.com/todo).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get the latest version clone this repo and run

`npm install` and `npm start` in your terminal.
